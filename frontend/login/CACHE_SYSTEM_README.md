# Music Caching System

This Flutter app now includes a sophisticated music caching system that automatically stores downloaded music files locally on the device for improved performance and offline playback.

## Features

### üöÄ **Automatic Caching**
- Music is automatically cached when played for the first time
- Subsequent plays use cached files for instant loading
- No manual intervention required

### üíæ **Smart Storage Management**
- Configurable cache size limit (default: 500MB)
- Automatic cleanup of least recently used files
- Efficient file naming with hash-based identifiers

### üì± **Offline Playback**
- Cached music plays without internet connection
- Seamless fallback to streaming if cache fails
- Background caching during streaming

### üéØ **Performance Benefits**
- Faster music loading after first download
- Reduced bandwidth usage
- Smoother playback experience

## How It Works

### 1. **First Play (Streaming + Caching)**
```
User plays music ‚Üí Stream from server ‚Üí Cache to local storage ‚Üí Play audio
```

### 2. **Subsequent Plays (From Cache)**
```
User plays music ‚Üí Check cache ‚Üí Load from local storage ‚Üí Play audio
```

### 3. **Cache Management**
- Files are stored in the app's documents directory
- Metadata tracks file information and access times
- Automatic cleanup when cache exceeds size limit

## File Structure

```
lib/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ music_cache_manager.dart      # Core caching logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cached_music_player.dart      # Enhanced music player with caching
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cache_management_screen.dart  # UI for managing cache
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ music-bar.dart               # Updated music bar with cache indicators
```

## Key Components

### MusicCacheManager
- Handles file storage and retrieval
- Manages cache metadata
- Implements automatic cleanup
- Provides cache statistics

### CachedMusicPlayer
- Extends the original music player
- Automatically checks cache before streaming
- Handles both cached and streaming playback
- Manages background caching

### CacheManagementScreen
- View cached music files
- Monitor cache statistics
- Remove individual files or clear entire cache
- Refresh cache information

## Usage

### Basic Playback
```dart
final musicPlayer = CachedMusicPlayer();

// Play music (automatically cached)
await musicPlayer.playMusic(
  musicName: "song.mp3",
  onDone: () => print("Song finished"),
  onError: (error) => print("Error: $error"),
);
```

### Check Cache Status
```dart
final isCached = await musicPlayer.checkIfCached("song.mp3");
print("Is cached: $isCached");
```

### Get Cache Statistics
```dart
final stats = await musicPlayer.getCacheStats();
print("Total files: ${stats['totalFiles']}");
print("Total size: ${stats['totalSize']} bytes");
```

### Manual Cache Management
```dart
// Remove specific file
await musicPlayer.removeFromCache("song.mp3");

// Clear entire cache
await musicPlayer.clearCache();
```

## Configuration

### Cache Settings
- **Cache Directory**: `music_cache/` in app documents
- **Max Cache Size**: 500MB (configurable)
- **File Format**: MP3 with hash-based naming
- **Metadata**: JSON file tracking file info

### Dependencies Added
```yaml
dependencies:
  path_provider: ^2.1.2    # File system access
  crypto: ^3.0.3           # Hash generation for filenames
```

## Benefits

### For Users
- ‚ö° **Faster Loading**: Instant playback after first download
- üì± **Offline Access**: Listen to cached music without internet
- üí∞ **Data Savings**: Reduced mobile data usage
- üéµ **Smoother Experience**: No buffering delays

### For Developers
- üîß **Easy Integration**: Drop-in replacement for existing player
- üìä **Monitoring**: Built-in cache statistics and management
- üõ°Ô∏è **Reliability**: Automatic fallback to streaming
- üéØ **Performance**: Optimized for mobile devices

## Cache Indicators

The music bar now shows visual indicators for cache status:

- **üü¢ Green Cloud**: Music is cached locally
- **‚ö™ White Cloud**: Music is streaming (not yet cached)
- **üìä Cache Stats**: Available in the cache management screen

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Cache Not Working**
   - Check app permissions for file access
   - Verify sufficient storage space
   - Restart the app

2. **Cache Size Issues**
   - Use cache management screen to clear old files
   - Check available device storage
   - Monitor cache statistics

3. **Playback Problems**
   - Cache automatically falls back to streaming
   - Check network connectivity
   - Verify music file integrity

### Debug Information
Enable debug logging to see detailed cache operations:
```dart
// Cache operations are logged with detailed information
print('Cache operation: ${operation}');
```

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] **Selective Caching**: Choose which songs to cache
- [ ] **Quality Settings**: Different cache qualities for different network conditions
- [ ] **Sync Across Devices**: Cloud-based cache synchronization
- [ ] **Analytics**: Detailed usage and performance metrics
- [ ] **Smart Preloading**: Predict and cache likely next songs

## Technical Details

### File Naming Convention
```
{hash}_{sanitized_filename}.mp3
Example: a1b2c3d4_to_kharab_kardi_golzar.mp3
```

### Cache Metadata Structure
```json
{
  "files": {
    "song_name": "filename.mp3"
  },
  "lastAccessed": {
    "song_name": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

### Performance Characteristics
- **First Play**: Network streaming + background caching
- **Cached Play**: Local file read (instant)
- **Cache Write**: Asynchronous, non-blocking
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal, streams data directly

## Contributing

When modifying the caching system:

1. **Test Cache Operations**: Verify both cached and streaming modes
2. **Check Memory Usage**: Ensure no memory leaks
3. **Validate File Operations**: Test on different devices and Android versions
4. **Update Documentation**: Keep this README current
